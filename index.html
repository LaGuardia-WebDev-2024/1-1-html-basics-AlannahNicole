      <h2Song Lyrics</h2>
  
<p>Light inside of me, guiding me, finally I can see you
And it took me so much time
Light inside of me, guiding me, finally I can leave you (yeah)
Think I got it right this time
Well, I guess that is just what I get 'cause I did what I did
And you said what you said, I meant it
And you really bring out the best in me, I cannot thank you enough
I guess that's why God's blessing me, show me so much grace and love
And it's totally because (yeah, yeah) </p> 
  
  <h2>Song Lyrics </h2>
  
  </p> I got a light inside of me, I got a light that's guiding me <br>
I got a lot of God in me and I can stand alone (alone) <br>
I got a light inside of me (ah), I got a light that's guiding me <br>
And I decided, finally, to leave your ass alone <br>
I tell you all of my trauma <br>
You say I'm too much drama <br>
I'm always the problem <br>
You run away like nothing, like nothing <br>
It's so hard for you, I'm too much <br>
And yet, not enough for you </p>
